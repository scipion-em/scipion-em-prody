    (PCA) added to devel 

1 April 2022
    Added tests for core pipeline

17 March 2022
    Added animate and qualify modes features from continuousflex to new 
    modes base protocol and used it to add these to the mode editing protocol

        2. Superposition

18 January 2022
    First working plugin with:
        1. installation of ProDy from GitHub 
        2. protocol for anisotropic network model (ANM)
           normal mode analysis (NMA)
        3. viewer for normal modes from itself or continuousflex

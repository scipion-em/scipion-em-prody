    2. Atomic structure ensemble analysis with principal component analysis

11 May 2022 - more releases with small improvements

13-18 April 2022 - first releases up to v3.0.3
    Core pipeline working well with ProDy 2.1.1

1 April 2022

    and interpolate operations.

9 February 2022
    Added protocol for mode comparison

3 February 2022
    Added atomic structure manipulation protocols:

        2. Superposition

18 January 2022
    First working plugin with:
        1. installation of ProDy from GitHub 
        2. protocol for anisotropic network model (ANM)
           normal mode analysis (NMA)
        3. viewer for normal modes from itself or continuousflex
